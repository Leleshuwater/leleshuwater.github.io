			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				I am Lele Shu, a post-doc in University of California, Davis since 2017. I graduated from Pennsylvania State University. My research interest is in high performance numeric methods in hydrologic modeling, hydrologic impact of land use and climate change, and couple-nature-human system.

				I am doing the watershed-scale numeric hydrologic modeling in California and assessing the change of ground water in past, present and future. Before the modeling in California, I did the hydrologic modeling in Pennsylvania, New York, Wisconsin, Africa, Guatemala, etc. I am developing the Penn State Integrated Model (PIHM) and PIHMgisR package.

				Besides of scientific work, I am fond of solving/explaining ideas with mathematic and programming methods. When I have a fun project, I will shared my thoughts and findings here.
